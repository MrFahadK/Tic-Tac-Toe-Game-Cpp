# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Cpp
This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Two players alternate turns to place 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features input validation to prevent moves on occupied cells and checks for win or draw.
